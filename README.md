## Contributing

Please discuss on an open issue or create a new one before forking, that way I can easily keep track of branches. Your participation is greatly appreciated, so I wouldn't want you to go through all the effort without confirming first!

## Developing

If you don't already have browser-sync install globally:

>`npm install`

Your options for running locally are:

```js
npm dev // run with browser-sync
```

```js
npm start // run with node, production-like
```
